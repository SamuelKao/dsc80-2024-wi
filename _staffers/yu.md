Hi! My name is Tiffany and I am a fourth-year Data Science student from Warren College. Besides studying, I love dancing, exercising and playing the piano. I have tutored DSC 10 for three quarters and DSC80 for two quarters. This is my 3rd time tutoring DSC 80. I am super excited to pass on my passion to all of you. I love making new friends. Feel free to chat with me after class! :)
