Hey there ! Really excited to be tutoring for dsc80 this quarter! I'm originally from Houston , Texas but am here now in San Diego majoring in Data Science. My current favorite restaurant is the Fire Spot on Convoy Street. Picked up a new hobby on planting tomato seeds. Feel free to ask any questions throughout the quarter!
