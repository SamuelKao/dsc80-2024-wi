Hello! My name is Dylan and I'm a second year master's student studying data science! I was born and raised right near Seattle, and went to the University of Washington for my bachelor's. I have been a TA here at UCSD before, but I have never taught DSC 80 so I'm excited to go into the more complicated material that we have. In my free time I train in MMA and love to workout in general, so if you see me at RIMAC say hi!
